# Architecture

High-level map of what's actually in Clawdi Cloud today — updated as the code changes. For end-user docs, see the top-level [`README.md`](../README.md) and [`using-clawdi-with-claude-code.md`](using-clawdi-with-claude-code.md).

---

## One-paragraph overview

Clawdi Cloud is a cross-agent sync + recall layer. A local CLI (`clawdi`) reads per-agent data (Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, OpenClaw) from well-known directories, pushes sessions and skills to a FastAPI backend, pulls shared skills back down, and exposes a long-term memory store to each agent via the Model Context Protocol. The web app is a read-mostly dashboard on the same backend. The memory store is the differentiator: it gives every connected agent the same cross-session, cross-machine context without the agents having to know about each other.

```

Two auth paths hit the same backend:

- **Clerk JWT** — from the web dashboard. Gets most endpoints. Cannot resolve vault secret values.
- **Bearer API key** (`clawdi_...`) — from the CLI and the MCP server it spawns. Required for `/api/vault/resolve` and for any agent-local operation that needs to read secrets.

---

## Data model

All keyed off Clerk `user_id`:

| Table | What it holds | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | Clerk user mirror + email | Sign-in |
| `api_keys` | SHA-256-hashed CLI bearer tokens | Dashboard |
| `agent_environments` | One row per (machine × agent). `agent_type ∈ {claude_code, codex, hermes, openclaw}` | `clawdi setup` |
| `sessions` | Per-conversation metadata: `environment_id`, `local_session_id`, `project_path`, token counts, model, summary, status. **Raw transcript body is in the file store**, keyed by `file_key` | `clawdi sync up` |
| `skills` | Per-skill metadata + tar.gz body in file store | CLI `skill add / install`, dashboard upload |
| `vaults` + `vault_items` | Three-level secrets: vault → section → field. Values are AES-256-GCM encrypted. `/vault/resolve` decrypts and returns plain values; CLI-only | `clawdi vault set` |
| `memories` | Long-term recall. `content` (text), `category`, `tags`, plus three search columns (`content_tsv` generated tsvector, `embedding vector(768)`) | CLI and MCP `memory_add` |
| `user_settings` | Opaque JSONB per-user prefs: `memory_provider` (`builtin` / `mem0`), `mem0_api_key` | `PATCH /api/settings` |

There is no `cron_job` / `channel` / `celery` / `background_task` table — those were in the original plan but never built. See [What's not implemented](#whats-not-implemented) below.

---

## Storage split

- **PostgreSQL** — structured metadata + memory search. Alembic manages the schema. Extensions enabled: `pg_trgm` (trigram fuzzy match), `vector` (pgvector for embeddings).
- **File store** — session transcripts (JSONL) and skill bodies (tar.gz). Abstracted via `app/services/file_store.py`; dev uses local filesystem (`./data/files/`), prod can be S3 / R2.
- **No Redis yet** — originally planned for task queue + cache; currently unused.

The separation is intentional: sessions can be multi-MB of JSONL; storing them in PG would bloat the DB and make dashboard queries slow. Metadata in PG, blobs in file store, metadata rows carry `file_key` pointers.

---

## Memory retrieval

The highest-signal path in the system. Four layers, hybrid-merged:

1. **`tsvector` full-text search** (always on). `content_tsv` is a generated column with `to_tsvector('simple', content)`. Ranks with `ts_rank_cd` against `websearch_to_tsquery`. The `simple` dictionary is language-agnostic — mixed EN/CN memories just work, no per-language config.
2. **`pg_trgm` trigram similarity** (always on). Handles typos, out-of-order words, partial terms. GIN index on `content` with `gin_trgm_ops`.
3. **`pgvector` semantic search** (active when `MEMORY_EMBEDDING_MODE=local` or `=api`). HNSW index on a 768-dim column. Default embedder is `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2` via [fastembed](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed) — CPU ONNX, no API key, first use downloads ~1GB. API mode swaps in OpenAI / OpenRouter.
4. **Merge + rerank** — vector and FTS results are normalized, weighted (0.7 / 0.3), a 30-day-half-life temporal decay is applied, and a Jaccard-token MMR pass diversifies the top-N so near-duplicates don't crowd out distinct memories.

Both vector and FTS have **strict / relaxed** score floors — strict first, relaxed fallback if empty — so abstract queries against narrowly-phrased memories still surface something instead of returning empty.

The `BuiltinProvider` (`backend/app/services/memory_provider.py`) owns this. `Mem0Provider` is the alternative — thin wrapper around [Mem0's](https://mem0.ai) cloud API, selected per-user via `user_settings.memory_provider = "mem0"` + a `mem0_api_key`. Selection precedence:

```
user's memory_provider = "mem0" + mem0_api_key present     → Mem0Provider
otherwise                                                   → BuiltinProvider
  with embedder determined by deployment env:
    MEMORY_EMBEDDING_MODE=local → fastembed              (default)
    MEMORY_EMBEDDING_MODE=api   → OpenAI-compatible
    anything else / missing key → FTS + trigram only
```

The embedder choice is **deployment-level**, not per-user — it's an operator concern (which GPU / API bill / privacy posture you want), not something users should pick.

---

## Agent adapters

All four agents implement the same interface (`packages/cli/src/adapters/base.ts`):

```ts
interface AgentAdapter {
  agentType: AgentType;
  detect(): Promise<boolean>;
  getVersion(): Promise<string | null>;
  collectSessions(since?, projectFilter?): Promise<RawSession[]>;
  collectSkills(): Promise<RawSkill[]>;
  getSkillPath(key: string): string;
  writeSkillArchive(key: string, tarGzBytes: Buffer): Promise<void>;
  buildRunCommand(args: string[], env: Record<string, string>): string[];
}
```

Per-agent specifics:

| Agent | Sessions at | Skills at | Version command |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/projects/<hash>/*.jsonl` (one JSONL per session) | `~/.claude/skills/<key>/SKILL.md` (flat) | `claude --version` |
| **Codex** | `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ts>-<uuid>.jsonl` | `~/.codex/skills/<key>/SKILL.md` (skips `.system/`) | `codex --version` |
| **Hermes** | `~/.hermes/state.db` (SQLite) | `~/.hermes/skills/<category>/<key>/SKILL.md` (recursive) | `hermes --version` |
| **OpenClaw** | `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/sessions.json` index + per-session JSONL | `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/skills/<key>/SKILL.md` (flat) | `openclaw --version` |

The MCP server registration path also differs per agent — see `commands/setup.ts`:

- Claude Code → `claude mcp add-json clawdi ...`
- Codex → `codex mcp add clawdi ...`
- Hermes → direct YAML edit of `~/.hermes/config.yaml`
- OpenClaw → prints a manual-config hint (its ACP bridge rejects per-session MCP declarations)

---

## Sync engine

`clawdi sync up` and `clawdi sync down` share a selector that picks the target agent:

1. Explicit `--agent <type>` flag wins.
2. Else look at `~/.clawdi/environments/*.json` — if exactly one registered, pick it.
3. Else fall back to `adapter.detect()` on all four; if exactly one matches, pick it.
4. Else prompt (arrow-key picker).

Sync state (`sessions.lastSyncedAt`, `skills.lastSyncedAt`) lives in `~/.clawdi/sync.json` — **the server is stateless about sync**. The CLI sends `?since=` filters on upload. This keeps the server simple and lets multiple machines sync independently.

Per-project filter: `sync up` defaults to the current working directory as a filter. `--all` disables it, `--project <path>` overrides. Hermes ignores the filter (its sessions have no `cwd`); it prints a yellow warning and syncs everything instead of silently dropping the filter.

---

## Vault

Three-level layout: vault → section → field. Example paths:

```
clawdi://default/openai/api_key
clawdi://prod/stripe/secret_key
clawdi://prod/database/url
```

Values encrypted with AES-256-GCM (`vault_encryption_key` env var is the master key). The backend has two vault endpoints:

- `/api/vault/*` — CRUD, accessible from the web dashboard, but **never returns plain values**
- `/api/vault/resolve` — returns `{ KEY: plain_value, ... }`, **only accepts CLI API keys**, rejects Clerk JWTs at the auth layer

`clawdi run -- <cmd>` hits `/vault/resolve`, merges the returned env into the child process's environment, and `exec`s. This lets the user commit `.env` files with `OPENAI_API_KEY=clawdi://default/openai/api_key` without exposing the real secret in git — at runtime the CLI substitutes.

---

## MCP server

`clawdi mcp` runs a stdio MCP server. Registered by `clawdi setup` with each agent, so the agent spawns it on startup. Two native tools:

- `memory_search(query, limit?)` — proxies to `GET /api/memories?q=...`
- `memory_add(content, category?)` — proxies to `POST /api/memories`

Plus **dynamically-registered connector tools** — at MCP init, the server fetches `/api/connectors/mcp-config` and `tools/list` from the user's Composio-backed proxy (`mcp_proxy` route), then registers each remote tool locally with a zod schema built from the Composio OpenAPI metadata. When the agent calls one (e.g. `gmail_fetch_emails`), the local MCP server forwards the call through the backend's `mcp_proxy`. The proxy mediates auth so the connector's real OAuth token never leaves the backend.

Tool descriptions on `memory_search` / `memory_add` are intentionally verbose and list concrete trigger patterns — the failure mode for a new agent is "didn't call memory when it obviously should have", and short descriptions leave too much to the agent's judgment. The `clawdi` skill installed to `~/.claude/skills/clawdi/` (and the equivalent paths on other agents) reinforces the same triggers in long-form.

## What's not implemented

Several items were scoped but not built. Named for discoverability if someone picks them up:

- **Celery / background tasks** — no async task queue. Memory is embedded synchronously on `memory_add`.
- **Session → Memory LLM pipeline** — sessions are just stored; nothing auto-extracts memories from transcripts. Users / agents add memories explicitly.
- **CronJobs** — no `cron_job` table, no scheduler. `scripts/embed_memories.py` exists as a manual operator-level tool.
- **Channels (Telegram / Discord / Slack bots)** — no code, no table.
- **Cognee memory provider** — only `Builtin` and `Mem0`.
- **Browser-based `clawdi login`** — the implemented flow is "paste your API key", same UX but no OAuth dance.
- **`bun build --compile` single-binary distribution** — currently `bun link` over the workspace.

If you pick any of these up, add an ADR or module plan under `docs/plans/` before implementing — this top-level doc is descriptive of what exists, not speculative.
