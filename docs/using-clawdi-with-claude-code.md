# Using Clawdi with Claude Code

End-to-end guide for connecting Claude Code to Clawdi Cloud and using it day-to-day. Assumes you've already set up the project (backend + web) per the root `README.md`, and that Claude Code is installed on your machine.

---

## One-time setup

### 1. Log in

```bash
$ clawdi login
To get an API key:
  1. Go to the Clawdi Cloud dashboard
  2. Open user menu → API Keys
  3. Create a new key and copy it

Paste your API key: clawdi_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

✓ Logged in as you@example.com
  Credentials saved to ~/.clawdi/auth.json
```

Verify:

```bash
$ clawdi status
Clawdi Cloud Status

  Auth:    ✓ logged in
  User:    you@example.com
  API:     http://localhost:8000

  Sync:    no sync history
```

### 2. Register Claude Code as an agent

```bash
$ clawdi setup --agent claude_code
✓ Claude Code registered
✓ MCP server registered in Claude Code
✓ Clawdi skill installed in Claude Code
```

What this does:
- Creates a row in the backend `AgentEnvironment` table for this machine + Claude Code
- Runs `claude mcp add-json clawdi '...' --scope user` so Claude Code spawns the Clawdi MCP server on every launch
- Copies the bundled `clawdi` skill to `~/.claude/skills/clawdi/SKILL.md` so Claude Code can surface memory-retrieval guidance

Re-running `clawdi setup --agent claude_code` later is safe — the skill is overwritten with the latest bundled version; the MCP registration is idempotent.

### 3. (Re)start Claude Code

Quit and reopen Claude Code so it picks up the new MCP server and skill. Inside Claude Code:

```
/mcp
```

You should see `clawdi · ✔ connected` in the list. Drilling into it shows the tools it exposes: `memory_search`, `memory_add`, plus any connector tools (Gmail / GitHub / etc.) you've authorized in the dashboard.

## Daily workflow

### A. Memory — save things, recall them later

In a Claude Code session, ask Claude to remember something:

```
You: remember that we use pnpm, not npm, in this monorepo
```

Claude will invoke the `memory_add` tool (you'll see the call in the transcript) and store the memory in your Clawdi Cloud account. It's now readable from any other agent you connect.

Open a **new** Claude Code session a week later — no shared conversation state — and ask:

```
You: which package manager should I use here?
```

Claude should auto-invoke `memory_search`, pull back your stored preference, and answer with it. This works because the `clawdi` skill installed during setup tells Claude to search memory at the start of any question about you, your project, or your preferences.

Inspect what's stored from the CLI anytime:

```bash
$ clawdi memory list
$ clawdi mem list                            # shorter alias

$ clawdi memory search "package manager"     # semantic search (any language)
$ clawdi mem search "我的偏好"                 # works in Chinese too

$ clawdi memory add "我用 pnpm 不用 npm"      # add from CLI directly
$ clawdi memory rm <memory-id>                # delete
```

**Categories**: when Claude saves a memory it picks one of `fact` / `preference` / `pattern` / `decision` / `context`. You can filter from the CLI or the dashboard.

### B. Vault — inject secrets at runtime without putting them on disk

Store a secret once:

```bash
$ clawdi vault set OPENAI_API_KEY
Value for OPENAI_API_KEY: ••••••••••
✓ Stored OPENAI_API_KEY
```

List what's stored (values never leave the CLI unmasked):

```bash
$ clawdi vault list
  default
    OPENAI_API_KEY
    GITHUB_TOKEN
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

Run any command with the vault injected into its environment:

```bash
$ clawdi run -- python app.py
✓ Injected 3 vault secrets
# ... your app runs with $OPENAI_API_KEY etc. already set
```

You can ask Claude to run the command for you. Claude uses the `Bash` tool; just tell it to prefix with `clawdi run --`:

```
You: run the ingestion script with my vault secrets injected
Claude: → Bash(`clawdi run -- python scripts/ingest.py`)
```

Secrets live encrypted in the backend; the web dashboard can list keys but cannot read values. Only the CLI (authenticated with an API key) can resolve them.

### C. Skills — portable instructions that all your agents share

```bash
# List skills in your Clawdi account
$ clawdi skill list

# Upload a local directory as a skill (must contain SKILL.md)
$ clawdi skill add ./skills/my-review-flow

# Install a public skill from GitHub (owner/repo or owner/repo/path)
$ clawdi skill install anthropics/skills
$ clawdi skill install anthropics/skills/artifacts-builder

# Remove from cloud
$ clawdi skill rm artifacts-builder
```

When you `install` a skill, it's fetched by the backend, stored in the cloud, AND extracted to every registered agent's local skills directory — so for Claude Code it lands at `~/.claude/skills/<skill-key>/SKILL.md` automatically. No separate `sync down` needed.

Inside Claude Code, skills become available via `/skill` or when Claude decides the skill's `description` matches the task.

### D. Sessions — sync your conversations to the cloud for review

After a day of work in Claude Code:

```bash
$ clawdi sync up
Agent:   Claude Code
Modules: sessions, skills

→ Scanning local data...

Summary
  Sessions: 12 to upload
  Skills:   4 to upload

Proceed with upload? [Y/n] y
→ Uploading 12 sessions...
  ✓ Synced 12 sessions
→ Uploading session content...
  ✓ Uploaded 10 session contents
→ Uploading 4 skills...
  ✓ Synced 4 skills

✓ Sync complete
```

Only sessions from the current project are pushed by default (uses `cwd` at invocation time). To sync everything:

```bash
$ clawdi sync up --all
```

Other useful flags:

```bash
$ clawdi sync up --modules sessions      # only sessions, skip skills
$ clawdi sync up --since 2026-04-01      # manual cursor
$ clawdi sync up --agent claude_code     # skip the agent picker on multi-agent machines
$ clawdi sync up --dry-run               # preview, no uploads
```

Pull skills the other direction:

```bash
$ clawdi sync down
```

After sync, open <http://localhost:3000/sessions> in the web dashboard to browse the conversations, see tokens consumed per session, re-read Claude's responses rendered as markdown, etc.

## Example flow from zero to useful memory

```bash
# Day 1 — bootstrap
$ clawdi login
$ clawdi setup --agent claude_code
# (restart Claude Code)

# Day 1 inside Claude Code, while coding:
You: remember I prefer rg over grep and fd over find for searching files
Claude: → memory_add({ content: "The user prefers rg over grep and fd over find...", category: "preference" })
        ✓ Memory stored (abc12345)

You: also remember we chose Clerk for auth because the team already had an account
Claude: → memory_add({ content: "We chose Clerk for auth because the team already had an account", category: "decision" })
        ✓ Memory stored (def67890)

# ... lots of work, quit Claude Code ...

# Day 7 — new session, no context carried over:
You: what's my preferred tool for searching code?
Claude: → memory_search({ query: "preferred tool for searching code" })
        [preference] The user prefers rg over grep and fd over find for searching files.
Claude: You prefer rg over grep for code search. Want me to use rg in the next command?

# Day 7, same session, a harder question:
You: why did we pick our auth provider?
Claude: → memory_search({ query: "auth provider decision" })
        [decision] We chose Clerk for auth because the team already had an account
Claude: You chose Clerk because the team already had a Clerk account.
```

All four pieces work together: `setup` wires up MCP + skill, which makes Claude's judgment biased toward calling the tools; when Claude calls them, they talk to the backend; the backend uses either FTS + vector search to retrieve; results come back as context Claude uses to answer.

## Running multiple agents from the same machine

If you also have Codex / Hermes / OpenClaw installed on this machine:

```bash
$ clawdi setup                   # auto-detects and asks to register each one
```

Any memory you add from Claude Code is visible from every other agent you've registered, and vice-versa. `clawdi sync up` then prompts you to pick which agent's sessions/skills to push:

```
Multiple agents registered. Select one:
  [1] Claude Code
  [2] Codex
  [3] Hermes
Choice: 1
```

Or skip the prompt with `--agent`:

```bash
$ clawdi sync up --agent codex
```

## Command cheat sheet

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `clawdi login` / `logout` / `status` | Auth and state |
| `clawdi config set apiUrl <url>` | Point CLI at a non-default backend (env: `CLAWDI_API_URL`) |
| `clawdi setup --agent claude_code` | One-time: register Claude Code + MCP + skill |
| `clawdi sync up` | Push sessions + skills to the cloud |
| `clawdi sync down` | Pull skills from the cloud into Claude Code's skills dir |
| `clawdi memory list / search / add / rm` | Inspect or edit cross-agent memory (alias: `mem`) |
| `clawdi vault set / list / import` | Manage runtime secrets |
| `clawdi run -- <cmd>` | Run a command with vault secrets injected |
| `clawdi skill list / add / install / rm` | Manage skills |
| `clawdi mcp` | Start MCP stdio server (invoked by Claude Code automatically) |

All subcommands support `--help`.

## Troubleshooting

**Claude Code doesn't call `memory_search` on an obvious question**
Quit Claude Code fully (`/exit` or Cmd+Q) and reopen. It caches MCP tool descriptions at session start; if you upgraded the CLI recently, an old cache may still be in place.

**`clawdi memory list` works but Claude says "no memory found"**
Verify Claude actually called the tool — look in your Claude Code transcript for a tool-use entry. If it didn't call: try a more specific phrasing ("what's my X?", "remember Y"). If it did call and still got nothing: the stored phrasing and query may be too far apart in semantic space; check with `clawdi memory search "<same query>"` directly.

**`clawdi sync up` says "No environment registered"**
Run `clawdi setup --agent claude_code` first. It creates the `AgentEnvironment` row sync needs.

**`/mcp` in Claude Code doesn't list clawdi**
Check `claude mcp list` at the shell. If clawdi is missing, `clawdi setup --agent claude_code` re-registers it.

**Memory feature works locally but dashboard shows nothing**
You're searching the right user's account? `clawdi status` shows the email the CLI is logged in as; compare to the email you logged into the web dashboard with.

**`clawdi setup` says "Could not auto-register MCP server"**
The `claude` binary isn't on PATH when you ran setup. Install Claude Code CLI first (ensure `claude --version` works), then re-run setup.
